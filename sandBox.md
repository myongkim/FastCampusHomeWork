- Bundle Package is the one will be executed when we run the program. 



Gitignore.io



Info.plist

- Information property list

application support - user cannot delete or mutate the item. so secure data should be in application support instead of Documents. 



Documents - is the place where user can manupulate the data ( delete, add, etc. )
